## [Wine Glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daily3D/comments/1m5i9s4/daily3d_for_250721glass_of_wine/)
  I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/jCVEtLjpeB8?si=q112PcTl8CLv6WWQ), but made a wine glass instead as part of the daily. I had lots of issues with the render. I couldn't understand the lighting at all since the video didn't explain the weird reflection effects I was getting, googling it didn't seem to help too. Modeling was a lot of fun though, I enjoyed making an object with vectors only
