# Welcome to my Blender Portfolio!

### [Ways to get in touch with me](https://linktr.ee/Peacook)

## My Portfolio:
- [Daily Challenges](https://github.com/ThePeacook/Blender-Portfolio/tree/main/Daily3D%20Reddit)
- [Learning Blender](https://github.com/ThePeacook/Blender-Portfolio/tree/main/Learning%20Blender)

## My Experience:
- 8/10 - Navigating - I need to learn more shortcut keys; other than that, I do very well at it
- 8/10 - Object Mode - Object mode is the simplest thing to use, and I know how to use it fully, but I didn't look at everything it offers
- 5/10 - Edit Mode - I know how to edit comfortably, but I still have to look up things to understand it
- 3/10 - Rendering - I know how to render, but I still don't feel comfortable using it
- 2/10 - Materials - I know how to use Materials, but tweaking the material to look just right has been a struggle for me
- 2/10 - Animation - I know how to animate, but I only made one project out of it, and I know there's lots more to learn
- 0/10 - UV Editing - Looked into a little
- 0/10 - Texturing - Looked into a little
- 0/10 - Rigging - Never looked into

## My Weaknesses:
- Rendering with lighting and transparency
- I dislike using modifiers, as it makes it feel like I am not truly making those objects

## Things I am currently not planning on doing:
- 2D
- Sculpting
- Compositing
- Geometry Nodes
- Coding
