# Learning Blender

  I am going to watch [this entire playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFlNqVVeLRwxPka8Ia1s21CS380folEA&si=Ry1s9J6yCDHpZwcb) made by [sorry stacy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3AOLFI3GsXAuRhYOR-wyA) and document my progress. This type of low-poly style is something I love, so I'm hoping I can create this in the future

  ## Second Build
  Currently in the process of watching [this video](https://youtu.be/8VmXzjgWQEg?si=tQnfDizexSrvXcY-). I have finished learning most of the modeling tools (38 Minutes in) and just finished with 2 models: A warehouse building (Just a box with a hole in it) and a Garage Door

Making the garage door was a hassle. I could've used the spin tool for the last 6 blocks, but I did it manually instead, duplicating each tall and small block and snapping them together (Still using edit mode). Also, the color looked odd for the garage door and I learned to use 'Shift+N' when that happens
  
  ## First Build
  I followed the guide in [this video](https://youtu.be/uOmYInaX-wE?si=HwOj1ibuq26Y7SHJ). It taught me the basics of Blender very well. My biggest trouble I had was the lighting, but I feel confident about the rest. Various times, I got distracted and did my own thing. I was only meant to use object mode in the guide, but I did use edit mode on the bottom of the bush (You'll have to view it in the file), and the ground, which was originally a cylinder that I beveled and merged. I also made sure to make the models my way, as that challenges me to be creative
