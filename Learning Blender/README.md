# Learning Blender

  I am going to watch [this entire playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFlNqVVeLRwxPka8Ia1s21CS380folEA&si=Ry1s9J6yCDHpZwcb) made by [sorry stacy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3AOLFI3GsXAuRhYOR-wyA) and document my progress. This type of low-poly style is something I love, so I'm hoping I can create this in the future

  ## Ice Glass Build
  I will be watching [this video](https://youtu.be/jCVEtLjpeB8?si=q112PcTl8CLv6WWQ). I will also be making a wine glass from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daily3D/comments/1m5i9s4/daily3d_for_250721glass_of_wine/)

  ## Isometric Room Build
  I will be skipping [these](https://youtu.be/J6b_pcAX1TQ?si=q7e2-6FREk54EysJ) [three](https://youtu.be/9o7RDkFhOxg?si=BeNI9miF_BTCAg9N) [videos](https://youtu.be/Pe7WD586jzk?si=PzDOez3inC_5RS0D). I had a hard time following the video, and I felt that I wasn't learning. I am also using Blender 4.5.0, and I believe these videos are outdated. At 2:12 in the video, her faces was different from mine, and I couldn't continue. I swear I tried my best to continue through the video, but I have no clue. Even the more recent people in the comments are lost

  ## Edit Mode Build
  I watched half of [this video](https://youtu.be/8VmXzjgWQEg?si=tQnfDizexSrvXcY-). I skipped the part where he made his build, and I decided on making a warehouse instead of a cafe. If I do have trouble with editing, I will check back to see if I missed anything important, but I am now comfortable using Object and Edit Mode. With lighting this time around? I'm starting to get it, but I'll need some more practice with it to be comfortable with it. I did have lots of trouble with modeling certain objects, but I figured them all out and was able to complete my vision without skipping any steps I planned on doing! Proud of myself for that

The garbage bag was the only object I used to copy the reference from inside the game. Each bag looks different because I used the randomizer for proportional editing and moved/scaled them around a bit. You can't see it in the render, but I still had fun making the bags look different

I purposely didn't smooth out anything, because I wasn't going for a plastic/realistic look, I wanted to show the low polygons as it's the artstyle I'm going for. I did add too much detail to some parts, but that was mainly me testing out the tools, so I wasn't FULLY focused on the artstyle

  ## Object Mode Build
  I followed the guide in [this video](https://youtu.be/uOmYInaX-wE?si=HwOj1ibuq26Y7SHJ). It taught me the basics of Blender very well. My biggest trouble I had was the lighting, but I feel confident about the rest. Various times, I got distracted and did my own thing. I was only meant to use object mode in the guide, but I did use edit mode on the bottom of the bush (You'll have to view it in the file), and the ground, which was originally a cylinder that I beveled and merged the tip. I also made sure to make the models my way, as that challenges me to be creative
