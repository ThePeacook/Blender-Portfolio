# Learning Blender

  I am going to watch [this entire playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFlNqVVeLRwxPka8Ia1s21CS380folEA&si=Ry1s9J6yCDHpZwcb) made by [sorry stacy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3AOLFI3GsXAuRhYOR-wyA) and document my progress. This type of low-poly style is something I love, so I'm hoping I can create this in the future

  When modeling the controller, I encountered numerous issues, but I continued to work on it nonetheless. Xbox controllers are really hard to model for a beginner. I almost gave up completely on the build due to that, but I somehow made it. I learned animation mainly with [this video](https://youtu.be/dHRl2n_-vds?si=uEb_9xh0WdCzuoOu). The playlist video wasn't as helpful compared to the other one I watched

  I will be skipping all 3 videos. I had a hard time following the video, and I felt that I wasn't learning. I am also using Blender 4.5.0, and I believe these videos are outdated. At 2:12 in the video, her faces were different from mine, and I couldn't continue. I swear I tried my best to continue through the video, but I have no clue. Even the more recent people in the comments are lost

  In the download, I added floor tiles just for the fun of it, but it wasn't the correct floor that the tutorial was showing

  ## [Edit Mode Tutorial](https://youtu.be/8VmXzjgWQEg?si=tQnfDizexSrvXcY-)
  I watched half of it. I skipped the part where he made his build, and I decided on making a warehouse instead of a cafe. If I do have trouble with editing, I will check back to see if I missed anything important, but I am now comfortable using Object and Edit Mode. With lighting this time around? I'm starting to get it, but I'll need some more practice with it to be comfortable with it. I did have lots of trouble with modeling certain objects, but I figured them all out and was able to complete my vision without skipping any steps I planned on doing! Proud of myself for that

  The garbage bag was the only object I used to copy the reference from inside the game. Each bag looks different because I used the randomizer for proportional editing and moved/scaled them around a bit. You can't see it in the render, but I still had fun making the bags look different

  I purposely didn't smooth out anything, because I wasn't going for a plastic/realistic look, I wanted to show the low polygons as it's the artstyle I'm going for. I did add too much detail to some parts, but that was mainly me testing out the tools, so I wasn't FULLY focused on the art style

  ## [Object Mode Tutorial](https://youtu.be/uOmYInaX-wE?si=HwOj1ibuq26Y7SHJ)
  It taught me the basics of Blender very well. My biggest trouble I had was the lighting, but I feel confident about the rest. Various times, I got distracted and did my own thing. I was only meant to use object mode in the guide, but I did use edit mode on the bottom of the bush (You'll have to view it in the file), and the ground, which was originally a cylinder that I beveled and merged the tip. I also made sure to make the models my way, as that challenges me to be creative
