# Learning Blender

  I am going to watch [this entire playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFlNqVVeLRwxPka8Ia1s21CS380folEA&si=Ry1s9J6yCDHpZwcb) made by [sorry stacy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3AOLFI3GsXAuRhYOR-wyA) and document my progress. This type of low-poly style is something I love, so I'm hoping I can create this in the future

  ## Isometric Room Build
  Later, I'll be watching [this video](https://youtu.be/J6b_pcAX1TQ?si=q7e2-6FREk54EysJ).

  ## Edit Mode Build
  I watched half of [this video](https://youtu.be/8VmXzjgWQEg?si=tQnfDizexSrvXcY-). I skipped the part where he made his build, and I decided on making a warehouse instead of a cafe. If I do have trouble with editing, I will check back to see if I missed anything important, but I am now comfortable using Object and Edit Mode. With lighting this time around? I'm starting to get it, but I'll need some more practice with it to be comfortable with it

The garbage bag was the only object I used to copy the reference from inside the game. Each bag looks different because I used the randomizer for proportional editing and moved/scaled them around a bit. You can't see it in the render, but I still had fun making the bags look different

I did have lots of trouble with modeling certain objects, but I figured them all out and was able to complete my vision without skipping any steps I planned on doing! Proud of myself for that

  ## Object Mode Build
  I followed the guide in [this video](https://youtu.be/uOmYInaX-wE?si=HwOj1ibuq26Y7SHJ). It taught me the basics of Blender very well. My biggest trouble I had was the lighting, but I feel confident about the rest. Various times, I got distracted and did my own thing. I was only meant to use object mode in the guide, but I did use edit mode on the bottom of the bush (You'll have to view it in the file), and the ground, which was originally a cylinder that I beveled and merged the tip. I also made sure to make the models my way, as that challenges me to be creative
